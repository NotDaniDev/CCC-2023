# CCC-2023
My codes for CEMC Canadian Computing Challenge 2023 in python juniors 

I achieved to get 48/75 full in the first 3 problems and after many tries 3/15 in J4 , spent a hour on J5 but couldn't get it to work but worked on it afterwards 
and managed to get the right answer as per the sample inputs and outputs not sure about the rest of the test cases.
